# Memory Game Project

This is my memory game project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## How to Play

On this game board sits a 4 by 4 grid of cards facing down initially. Click a card to start the game, the cards flip on click. You can only flip 2 cards in one turn. If the 2 cards match each other, they stay flipped. Otherwise, they flip back down, and you can continue to click on cards. There are supposed to be 8 match of 16 cards in total.

You win the game when all 16 cards are flipped up, and a modal'll show up after that, detailing how many moves(2 clicks) you performed, the number of stars you earned, and the total time used since first click. Click the "Play again!" button to restart the game. Additionally, there's a reset button on the upper-right end that allows you to restart the game at anytime.

## Acknowledgements

This project takes the template provided by Udacity as starting point. I don't own the basic template. I only use vanilla JavaScript (in this case ES6), HTML5, and CSS3 to build the game, except for the Bootstrap link in the starting template, which I'm yet to really understand.
