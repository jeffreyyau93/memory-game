# Memory Game Project
This is my memory game project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The game is not functional yet, and the code will incrementally change before the program ends.
## Acknowledgements
This project takes the template provided by Udacity as starting point. The code will evolve along with time, but I don't own the basic template.

This is a personal project for a online learning program, so I'll not accept any pull request.
